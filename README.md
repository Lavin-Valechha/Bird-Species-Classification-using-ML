Wine Quality Detection using Machine Learning
Overview
This project aims to predict the quality of wine using various physicochemical properties through machine learning models. By leveraging a dataset that includes metrics like acidity, sugar content, pH level, and others, this project demonstrates the application of multiple machine learning algorithms to classify wine quality effectively.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available in the file named Wine_quality.docx. It includes data for several attributes such as:

Fixed Acidity
Volatile Acidity
Citric Acid
Residual Sugar
Chlorides
Free Sulfur Dioxide
Total Sulfur Dioxide
Density
pH
Sulphates
Alcohol
Quality (Target Variable)
The target variable Quality ranges from 0 to 10, where higher values represent better wine quality.

Project Structure
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and normalizing data to prepare it for training.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analysis of features, correlations, and data distribution.
Modeling: Implementation of various machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Evaluation: Comparing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Deployment: The final selected model is deployed using a user-friendly interface to predict wine quality based on user inputs.

matplotlib
seaborn
To install the required libraries, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Getting Started
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Lavin-Valechha/Wine-Quality-Detection-using-ML.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd Wine-Quality-Detection-using-ML
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Run the Wine_Quality_Detection.ipynb file to explore the data, train models, and evaluate their performance.

Model Performance
The performance of different models is evaluated and compared using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model that best balances these metrics is chosen for the final deployment.

Results
Best Model: Random Forest Classifier (example)
Accuracy: ~85%
Precision: ~84%
Recall: ~83%
F1 Score: ~83%
Usage
After running the notebook and training the model, you can input the physicochemical properties of a wine sample to predict its quality. Adjust the input parameters in the interface to see how different values affect the prediction.
